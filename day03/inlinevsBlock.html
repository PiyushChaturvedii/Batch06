    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>
      This is an example of inline elements and block elements in HTML. The
      <strong>h1</strong> tag <h3>Hello</h3>is a block element, which means it takes up the full width available and starts on a new line.
      The <strong>p</strong> tag is also a block element, while the <strong>span</strong> tag is an inline element that does not start on a new line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inline elements, like <span style="color: red;">this text</span>, do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
      Block elements, like this paragraph,<img src="./image/image1.jpg" width="200px"/> always start on a new line and take up the full width available.
